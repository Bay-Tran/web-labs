working on dimensions for rates in Lab 9 - CSTRs in series

make sure these are consistent with Lab 2 and that results
for reactor 1 in Lab 9 agree with results for Lab 2

Kflow needs to be defined in Lab 2 info

Kflow = (Q/Vcell)*(Vcell/Vpellet)/k-1

where k-1 is normalizing factor and is reactant desorption rate constant

At SS, Kflow*(PSIin - PSI) = -R = - ave d'less turnover freq

R = - Kflow * PSIin * X (conversion) across first mixing cell

where X = (PSIin - PSI) / PSIin

where PSI is d'less reactant conc

R (d'less) = r(mol/m3 pellet/s) / Cgmax (mol/m3) / k-1 (1/s)

R ?= - Kdiff*(dPSI/dLambda) at pellet (catalyst layer) external surface
