Web Labs - Interactive simulations for active learning on the web

To use these labs, go to this repository's github.io site https://richardherz.github.io/web-labs/ 

WARNING: use your browser's Back button, not the Web Labs link at the top of the lab page, which will take you to ReactorLab.net

For more info, go to this repository's wiki.

We are continuing to develop the code structure, so the newest labs have the latest code structure. We are not going to go back to revise earlier labs that continue to work for the user.

The numbering of these labs is parallel to the numbering of the same labs at our main site, http://reactorlab.net/web-labs/
