Was doing trivial edit of Reactor Lab home page in WordPress - change email image - and the page layout got messed up. This was a version in which I did not use iframe. Couldn't figure out how to fix it. 

Problem maybe related to new editor in WP? 

Got it to work again using iframe for the home_reactor JS. 

In the enclosed folder, the WP code editor version of the home page is in the dev folder.
