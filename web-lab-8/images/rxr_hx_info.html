  <p><b><i>Adiabatic PFR with feed-product heat exchange</i></b> - Web Labs at www.ReactorLab.net - by Richard K. Herz</p>

  <p>
    The system inlet flow enters the "cold side" of a heat exchanger, then
    flows to the inlet of an adiabatic, packed-bed, plug-flow reactor.
    The reaction is A &rarr; products over catalyst pellets.
    The reaction is first-order in reactant.
    For simplicity, the reaction equilibrium composition is
    specified to be almost all product under all conditions, i.e., an essentially
    irreversible reaction.
    The concentration of reactant A is represented as Ca. Constant fluid density
    is assumed. The variable Kf300 is the value of the forward reaction rate coefficient at 300 K.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the reaction enthalpy (heat of reaction) is negatively valued, the reaction
    is exothermic and heats the fluid, which tends to increase the reaction
    and energy release rates. The fluid leaving the reactor enters
    the "hot side" of the heat exchanger. For an exothermic reaction, this heats
    the inlet flow. This type of system is related to an "autothermal reactor" in which
    the heat exchanger is integrated with the reactor.
  </p>

  <p>This system has <b>feedback</b> of energy. As the lab starts running
    from the default conditions, notice the temperature change flow to the right
    in the cold side of the heat exchanger (bottom color panel),
    then from left to right in the reactor (top panel),
    then from right to left in the hot side of the exchanger, just above the cold side.
    This heats
    the cold side again and the process is repeated again in a <b>feedback loop</b>.
  </p>

  <p>This system can exbibit <b>hysteresis</b>. Click the Run button and let the system
    reach steady state at the default conditions with an inlet T of 340 K.
    Then decrease the System inlet T to 330 K and wait for steady state.
    Note the relatively high conversion of reactant to product.
  </p>
  <p>Next, decrease the inlet T to 320 K and wait for steady state. Finally, increase the
    inlet T back to the previous 330 K and wait for steady state. Note the
    relatively low conversion of reactant compared to the earlier result at 330K.
    Thus, there are <b>multiple steady states</b> at 330 K.
  </p>

  <p>Many industrial ammonia synthesis reactor (ammonia converter) designs contain
    a reactor-heat exchanger structure like this.
  </p>

  <p>At any instant, there are not exact matches between the heat exchanger cold outlet temperature and the reactor inlet temperature,
    nor between the reactor outlet and exchanger hot inlet because of transit times in the connecting pipes.
  </p>

  <p>Currently in this simulation, the only heat capacities which affect the dynamic response are that of the
    fluid and catalyst. The heat capacities of the reactor and exchanger bodies may
    be added later. The residence times of the reactor and heat exchanger are set equal.
  </p>

  <p>Parameters remaining constant:
    <ul>
      <li>Fluid density = 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup></li>
      <li>Fluid heat capacity = 2.24 kJ/kg/K</li>
      <li>Catalyst pellet density = 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup></li>
      <li>Pellet heat capacity = 1.24 kJ/kg/K</li>
      <li>Packed bed void fraction = 0.3</li>
    </ul>

  <p>About the web lab code - the following are the top-level Javascript code objects:
    <ul>
      <li>interface - handles user interactions with buttons, input fields, etc.</li>
      <li>controller - runs the simulation by periodically telling the process units to update their inputs and state </li>
      <li>processUnits - contains the process unit objects, which hold their state and model equations</li>
      <li>simParams - contains the general state of the simulation</li>
      <li>plotInfo - contains definitions of the x-y and color canvas plots</li>
      <li>plotter - plots the x-y and color canvas plots</li>
    </ul>
