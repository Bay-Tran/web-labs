% Alcohol by volume (ABV) is vol of pure alcohol used to make mixture divided 
% by volume of mixture after mixing, which is reduced from sum of volumes
% of water and ethanol used because of nonideal mixing.
% ABV is proportional to specific gravity of mixture as measured
% by a hydrometer in ethanol-water mixure.
