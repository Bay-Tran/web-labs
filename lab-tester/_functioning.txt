Thinking about introducing functional programming concepts -
JS objects don't get info from other objects by direct reference but
rather pass info in function arguments and get returned desired info

One advantage is that can add in the "get" function check for existence
and other checks and return error codes and only have one copy of that
checking code in project rather than every place in calling units.

ALSO see how many different things are asked from processUnits and
plotInfo, etc., and see if need separate gets or can check inputs
and combine in one get...

example of one way it is done now:
  a = processUnits[varUnitIndex]['profileData'][n][p][0];

way of getting result from function:
  a = getProcessUnits(varUnitIndex,'profileData',n,p,0)

code in processUnits - BUT THIS THROWS OFF LENGTH IN CONTROLLER...

getProcessUnits(varUnitIndex,plotType,n,p,nn) {
  // add if for existence and return be able to return an error code?
  // doing so might be an advantage to doing get function - see above
  return
    this.[varUnitIndex][plotType][n][p][nn];
}
